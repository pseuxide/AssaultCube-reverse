# AssaultCube-reverse
I decided to train myself by reversing this game once again.

All knowledges I've reviewed are written down in [Wiki](https://github.com/s3pt3mb3r/AssaultCube-reverse/wiki) section in Japanese.

It would be about IDA, Reclass, hooking, pointer, whatever I tend to forget or get confused.
